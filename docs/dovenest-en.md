## **Introduction**

### **Overview**

DoveNest develops **cooperatively planning agents** – AI personas that combine the strengths of **AI conversation partners** and **AI agents** in a seamlessly integrated whole.

---

### **Motivation**

Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly powerful and is taking on central roles in work, research, education, and everyday life. The foundation for this lies in ever more capable **models**, upon which **AI personas** are built. These AI personas largely determine how people can make practical use of AI.

---

### **The Problem with Existing AI Personas**

Today, AI personas generally fall into two categories:

1. **Conversation partners** – strong in dialogue, knowledge transfer, understanding complex issues, and creative ideation.  

2. **Agents** – specialized in autonomously executing precisely defined tasks through interfaces and tools.  

Humans, however, naturally move back and forth between **planning** and **action**. The current separation of categories causes friction:

* Switching between different AI personas, or  
* Switching between separate “modes” that often do not integrate smoothly.  

---

### **The DoveNest Solution**

Since both categories are often built on the same underlying models, there is no technical reason why a single AI persona could not excel at **both**.  
DoveNest provides exactly this: a **cooperatively planning agent** that unifies **understanding**, **planning**, and **acting** in one consistent interaction.

### **Core Characteristics of DoveNest**

* **Persistent memories** for an effective conversation partner – enabling knowledge, context, continuity, and relationship.  
* **Interface competence** for an effective agent – enabling direct execution of tasks and processes.  
* **Nonlinear interaction**: Long-running tasks can be executed in the background while the conversation continues seamlessly.  
* **Optional, context-driven memories**:  
  * Activated only when needed.  
  * Triggered by the human, the AI persona itself, or a separate mechanism.  

DoveNest establishes a new standard for AI personas: **unity instead of mode switching**, **seamless integration instead of isolated systems** – with interactions that flow as naturally as human work and thought.

## **Architecture of DoveNest**

### **The Three Layers**

An AI application is generally based on three layers:

1. **User Interface**  
   * The visible layer through which humans interact with the AI.  
   * Examples: websites, mobile apps, integrated chat windows, or other devices.  

2. **AI Persona Platform**  
   * The intermediate layer that shapes the *personality* and *capabilities* of the AI.  
   * It organizes context, memories, interfaces, and interaction with the human.  

3. **AI Model Infrastructure**  
   * Provides the computing power and the underlying language or multimodal intelligence.  
   * Typically provided by specialized vendors like OpenAI, but in principle interchangeable.  

This architecture is the same one used by systems such as ChatGPT or other modern AI services.

### **The Role of the AI Persona Platform**

The **AI persona platform** is decisive. It determines what an AI persona can actually achieve. Traditionally, this has meant either conversation partner or agent. DoveNest, however, combines both into a **cooperatively planning agent**.  

A key responsibility of the platform is the management of memories and specialized knowledge. The AI model itself contains vast knowledge but does not automatically learn new things through interaction. Instead, it sees a context generated by the platform: the most recent part of the conversation, supplemented by memories and additional knowledge.

#### **AI Conversation Partners**

An AI conversation partner is designed to be as human-like as possible in dialogue. Based on the conversation history, it generates responses that are helpful and pleasant – ideally without delay.  

Modern AI models already contain enough knowledge about many domains, including human emotions, to serve as effective conversation partners: analyzing problems, suggesting solutions, offering encouragement or comfort.  

They become even more effective when the platform supplements the context with **memories**, such as:  

* **Persistent memories**: information about projects, the human, the AI persona, and their relationship.  
* **Memory notes**: short descriptions of scenarios mentioned in conversation.  

---

#### **AI Agents**

AI agents execute tasks. The human describes an assignment, and the AI agent calls interfaces to perform it. Depending on type and complexity:  

* The human may need substantial prior knowledge to phrase the task correctly.  
* Execution may take a long time, making smooth conversation difficult.  
* In extreme cases, the agent becomes an unnecessary intermediary if the human could use the interfaces directly.  

For AI agents to be effective, the platform must manage:  

* Descriptions of how interfaces can be called (parameters, effects).  
* Access to the interfaces for executing calls.  

---

#### **Cooperatively Planning Agents**

Cooperatively planning agents integrate both worlds. Planning and execution merge seamlessly. The human does not need prior knowledge of interfaces but can simply describe their intention. Together with the AI persona, they explore possible actions. Once there is clarity, the AI persona triggers the relevant actions. The conversation continues immediately, even while tasks are still running in the background.  

To realize a cooperatively planning agent, the platform must deliver more than either a pure conversation partner or a pure agent. Key features include:  

* **Persistent memories** for basic knowledge of situation, abilities, and relationship.  
* **General information** about projects, the human, and the AI persona.  
* **Interface descriptions** (how they are called, what effects they produce).  
* **Access to interfaces** for execution.  
* **Flexible memory management**, enabling memories to be deactivated, summarized, or reactivated as needed – controlled by the human, the AI persona, or a separate mechanism.  
* **Asynchronous conversation flow**: The AI persona never blocks for long. The human can issue new requests at any time. The conversation includes references to clarify event sequences.  
* **Non-blocking interfaces** for long-running processes: calls trigger background tasks. Human and AI persona are notified once results are ready or too much time has passed.
