# DoveNest

DoveNest develops **cooperatively planning agents** â€“ AI personas that combine the strengths of **AI conversation partners** and **AI agents** in a seamlessly integrated whole.  
Our goal is to establish a new standard for AI personas: **unity instead of mode switching**, **seamless integration instead of isolated systems** â€“ with interactions that flow as naturally as human work and thought.

## Status

ğŸš§ **Early Development**  
This repository is at a very early stage. The vision and design are outlined in the whitepapers, but the implementation is still in progress.

---

## Vision

Todayâ€™s AI personas are usually either:

- **Conversation partners** â€“ skilled in dialogue, understanding, and ideation.
- **Agents** â€“ specialized in executing well-defined tasks through tools and APIs.

Humans, however, naturally move between **planning** and **acting**.  
DoveNest unifies both worlds into a single AI persona that can **understand, plan, and act** in one seamless interaction.
